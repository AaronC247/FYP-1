The Database (database.pgsql) needs to be imported to a postgresql compatible database system 

This can be imported by using the following command 
psql -U postgres MapTest < database.pgsql

Throughout the project the database was used in pgadmin with the following settings  
"host=localhost port=5432 dbname=Maptest user=postgres password="

The webpages use PHP so they need to be ran on an apache server

Once both of these are running you can go to the home.html page which provides a link to the two search types
Alternatively the search pages can be accessed directly by going to questions.html or compare.html
